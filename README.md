# Final-Project-Scrapify
Scrapify is a revolutionary product research method that helps entrepreneurs quickly find the newest innovative product. With a simple search of trendy hashtags that tiktokers post showing off the newest product they bought like #amazonfinds. Entreprenueurs would come across unique products that they usually wouldn't. Scrapify is not like the normal hashtag search on tiktok because you have the chance to input the amount of likes the video must have, so you could skip over all the lame videos. After you input the number of likes it has to have, Scrapify will list out all the videos that have those hashtags in order of greatest to least from the number of likes you input.

## How to run Scrapify:
- Open up tiktok.py, website.html, style.css.
- Run tiktok.py, put in the hashtag you want, how many videos you want to see (the more likes, the more videos you should put in), and the amount of likes it should at least have. Then click enter.
- The list should have a tuple of the video url and the number of likes the video has. 
- Watch video for further explanation.
